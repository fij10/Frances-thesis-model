These are the Rstudio scripts for Frances James' MSc model chapter. 
The model.with.parasitoids script is the simulation with both parasitoids but without the addition of the chemical controls (i.e., the control simulation). 
The para.sprays.tidy script is the simulation with the effects of the chemical controls. 
The data that were used are confidential.
